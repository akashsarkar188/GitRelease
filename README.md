# GitRelease 🚀

**GitRelease** is a powerful Android utility to track, download, and manage applications directly from GitHub repositories.

## Key Features
- **📦 Multi-Track Management**: Track both **Stable** and **Pre-release** versions of any repository.
- **🔗 Multi-Package Support**: Automatically handles repositories that use different package names for separate tracks (e.g., prod vs. beta builds).
- **🛡️ Safe Downgrades**: Detects if an update is a downgrade and prompts for a safe uninstallation before installing.
- **🔓 Private & Public Repos**: Support for personal access tokens to track private repositories.
- **⚙️ Built-in Self-Updates**: Automatically tracks and manages updates for GitRelease itself.
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Fully asynchronous architecture using Kotlin Coroutines for a smooth, lag-free experience.

## Quick Start
1. **Add Repo**: Enter the owner and name (e.g., `akashsarkar188/GitRelease`).
2. **Configure (Optional)**: Provide a Personal Access Token for private repos.
3. **Track**: View the latest releases and pre-releases in a unified dashboard.
4. **Install**: Download APKs and install/update with a single tap.
